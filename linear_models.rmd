## Including linear models

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r filter}
active_batters_2016 <- Batting %>% 
  filter(yearID == 2016, AB > 0) %>% # at least one at bat during 2016 year
  select(playerID) %>% 
  left_join(Batting, by='playerID')
```

```{r linear_model}
estimated_hits <- active_batters_2016 %>%
  group_by(playerID) %>% 
  do(
    coefs = lm(H ~ yearID, data = .) %>% tidy %>% select(estimate) %>% unlist #replace with a function
  ) %>% 
  left_join( # joins estimates to 2017 data for QC
    Batting2017 %>% 
      filter(AB > 0) %>%  # only show QC for 2017 players that had at least one at bat and no missing data
      select(Handle, H),
    by=c("playerID" = "Handle")
  ) %>%  
  mutate(
    estimate = ifelse(length(coefs) == 2, round(coefs[1] + coefs[2]*2017), round(coefs[1])),
    bias = estimate - H
  )
```
