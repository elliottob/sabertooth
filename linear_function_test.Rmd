library(tidyverse)
library(lattice)
library(broom)
library(purrr)

## R Markdown

```{r load data}
load("Baseball.RData")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
